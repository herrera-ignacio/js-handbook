# Architecture Baseline

For a robust and reliable architecture, we seek to have the following aspects covered when working with Javascript:

* Type Safety (TypeScript)
* Separation of Concern
* Feature Encapsulation
* Error Handling
* Response Handling
* Promise Management
* Robust Unit Tests
* Easy Deployment
* Don't Use Unified Front-Back Codebase
* Backend Independent of any Frontend
